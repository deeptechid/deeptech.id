# Getting Started with Gatsby Starter Novela

This guide will take you through setting up Novela with Gatsby Starter Novela.

### Step 1: Starter installation

##### With `gatsby-cli`:

```sh
gatsby new novela-site https://github.com/narative/gatsby-starter-novela
```

##### With `git clone`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:narative/gatsby-starter-novela.git novela-site

cd novela-site

yarn
```

### Step 2: Develop & Build

Once installed or cloned locally and all packages are installed you can begin developing your site.

```sh
# Run localhost
yarn dev

# Build your Gatsby site
yarn build
```

To learn more about adding Authors, Posts, and Site Metadata see:

- [Adding an Author](#step-4-adding-an-author)
- [Adding a Post](#step-5-adding-a-post)
- [Configuring Site Metadata](#step-6-configuring-sitemetadata)

# Getting Started from scratch

This guide will take you through adding Novela to a new project. You do not require any Gatsby starters or similar, but you can add Novela to an existing Gatsby project.

You can also view the completed [example repository](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela-example).

### Step 1: Installation

```sh
# Create an empty directory and go into it
mkdir novela-site && cd novela-site

# Add all required depedencies
yarn add react react-dom gatsby @narative/gatsby-theme-novela
```

### Step 2: Folder structure

Once you've installed React, Gatsby, and Novela you'll want to add your first Author and Post.

The recommended project structure for your content and site looks like this:

```
  novela-site
    ├── content
    │ ├── authors
    │ │   ├── avatars
    │ │   │    └── avatar.jpg
    │ │   └── authors.yml
    │ └── posts
    │     └── 2020-01-01-my-first-novela-post
    │         ├── images
    │         │   └── novela-hero.jpg
    │         └── index.mdx
    ├── node_modules
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    └── package.json
```

### Step 3: Using `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`

You must add `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela` as a plugin in `gatsby-config.js`.
`@narative/gatsby-theme-novela` is configurable through plugin options but we will use the defaults for now.

```js
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: ["@narative/gatsby-theme-novela"],
};
```

---

Once you've setup `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela` plugin in `gatsby-config.js` you can start creating your first Posts. In order to create a Post you also need at least one Author.

### Step 4: Adding an Author

In [step 2](#step-2-folder-structure) we created the folder structure of our project. We can now add an Author by populating `/content/authors/authors.yml`:

```
  novela-site
  └── content
    └── authors
        ├── avatars
        │    └── brotzky-avatar.jpg
        └── authors.yml
```

In `authors.yml` add an Author. There **must** be at least one `featured` Author.

`/content/authors/authors.yml`:

```yml
- name: Dennis Brotzky
  bio: |
    Written by Dennis Brotzky who lives and works in Vancouver building useful things.
    You should follow him on Twitter.
  avatar: ./avatars/brotzky-avatar.jpg
  featured: true
```

### Step 5: Adding a Post

Once you have at least one Author defined in `authors.yml` you can add your first Post.

Start by creating a new folder in `content/posts`. You can name it anything you like but we recommend including the date at the front to organize your posts. Once you've created your folder you can add an `index.mdx` file and an `images` folder.

`/content/posts/2020-01-01/index.mdx`

```yml
---
title: Why Narative loves Gatsby
author: Dennis Brotzky
date: 2019-04-27
hero: ./images/narative-gatsby-hero.jpg
excerpt: This is a love story about Narative and Gatsby
---
# And then under the heading YML you can insert any MDX you like
# like headings, links, code, images, etc
# This will show up in the body of your post
# ...
```

### Step 6: Configuring siteMetadata

In order to configure the theme to properly genreate the pages and meta tags you must add specific data to `siteMetadata`.

The fields that are unique to Novela are `hero.heading`, `hero.maxWidth`, and `social`.

Add your Site Metadata to the `gatsby-config.js` file.

```js
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Novela by Narative`,
    name: `Narative`,
    siteUrl: `https://gatsby-theme-novela.netlify.com`,
    description: `This is my description that will be used in the meta tags and important for search results`,

    // important to set the main text that appears in the hero
    hero: {
      heading: `Perspectives on technology, design and business from the team at Narative.`,
      maxWidth: 652,
    },
    social: [
      {
        name: `twitter`,
        url: `https://twitter.com/narative`,
      },
      {
        name: `github`,
        url: `https://github.com/narative`,
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: ["@narative/gatsby-theme-novela"],
};
```

### You can now run your site

Once all steps have been completed you can run your site. In the root of your project run `gatsby develop`.

If you ran into problems you can reference the [example repository](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela-example) or create an issue.

<br />

- [Data Sources](#data-sources)

# Data Sources

With the flexibility of Gatsby, Novela is able to pull different data sources to build your website. Right now we support Contentful and your local file system. All data sources can be combined together or used seperately.

### Local

Local is the default data source for Novela. Write MDX and YAML in order to generate posts and authors. This is the fastest and simplist way to get started.

To learn how to use the local file system the [Installation](#installation) steps.

### Contentful

Contentful provides the flexibility of a headless CMS which allows you to write content without committing new files and working in a text editor. The setup process is simple if you are familiar with Contentful.

You will need to setup your Contentful space and import the Novela model.

#### Setting up `gatsby-source-contentful` in your project

In order to use Contentful you must first install the plugin and `dotenv` in your project

```sh
yarn add gatsby-source-contentful dotenv
```

Then pass in the enviroment variables `.env` to the plugin

#### `.env`

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

#### `gatsby-config.js`

```js
require("dotenv").config();

plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-source-contentful",
    options: {
      spaceId: process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID,
      accessToken: process.env.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: "@narative/gatsby-theme-novela",
    options: {
      sources: {
        contentful: true,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

Finally, import the Contentful Model from Novela to get started. Novela Contentful Queries will not work without this exact data model.

#### [Novela Contentful Data](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/tree/master/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/contentful)

[Contentful space import docs](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/import)

Once you have your project setup with `gatsby-source-contentful` and `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela` and your Contentful space is setup with the imported model you are good to go.

# Customization

Once you've created the Logo component it should automatically appear in your site.

The technique we have used is called Component Shadowing and is a core feature of Gatsby Themes.

### Enabling Author pages

By default Author pages are not enabled. They can be enabled through the plugin option `authorsPage`

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@narative/gatsby-theme-novela",
      options: {
        authorsPage: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Changing styles

Novela allows you to change the default theme styling by updating the [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) values. If you're familiar with Styled Components or Emotion it's the same as adapting the theme you pass to `ThemeProvider`.

First, you must create a theme file and then you can override `novelaTheme` values.
[See all Novela theme values](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/tree/master/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui)

```js
// src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js

import novelaTheme from "@narative/gatsby-theme-novela/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui";

export default {
  ...novelaTheme,
  initialColorMode: `dark`,
  colors: {
    ...novelaTheme.colors,
    primary: "#000",
    secondary: "#73737D",
    accent: "#6166DC",
    grey: "#73737D",
    background: "#fff",
  },
};
```

### Component Shadowing

> This feature allows users to override a component in order to customize its rendering.

> Component Shadowing let’s you replace the theme’s original file, gatsby-theme-novela/src/components/Logo.js, with your own to implement any changes you need.

Any [component](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/tree/master/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/src/components) or [section](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela/tree/master/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/src/sections) is able to be replaced with your own custom component.

This opens up a full customization of Novela to your designed needs. You can copy any component directly from Novela and alter it how you like, or you can create your own component to replace Novela's entirely.

A basic example of component shadowing is explained below by [adding your logo](#adding-your-logo).

### Using images

Images can be added to Posts and customized to fit your content. Define a regular Markdown image that will default to Small or write HTML to customize the sizes. All images can be clicked to zoom.

```html
![This is the alt text for small image](./images/small.jpg)

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img src="./images/medium.jpg" alt="This is the alt text small image" />
</div>

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="./images/medium.jpg" alt="This is the alt text medium image" />
</div>

<div className="Image__Large">
  <img src="./images/large.jpg" alt="This is the alt text large image" />
</div>
```

| Size   |   Class Name    |          Desciption           |
| ------ | :-------------: | :---------------------------: |
| small  | Image\_\_Small  |       Width of the text       |
| medium | Image\_\_Medium | Larger than width of the text |
| large  | Image\_\_Large  |       Full width image        |

### Adding your logo

Your logo must be in SVG (vector) format in order to add it to the theme. This is required because we will be making a React component containing your SVG Logo.

Start by creating the component file at:

```
  novela-site
  └── src
    └── @narative
      └── gatsby-theme-novela
        └── components
          └── Logo
            └── index.js
```

It is important you create the exact folder structure so Gatsby knows to shadow this component. Once the file is created you can create your Logo component.

```jsx
import React from "react";

/**
 * Paste in your SVG logo and return it from this component.
 * Make sure you have a height set for your logo.
 * It is recommended to keep the height within 25-35px.
 */
export default function Logo() {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 106 28" height="30px">
      <path d="M62.9 12h2.8v10...." />
      <path fill="#fff" d="M25 14h-..." />
      <path d="M14 0C6.3..." fill="#639" />
    </svg>
  );
}
```

### Adding Mailchimp

Want to add a subscription newsletter to your Posts? Novela gives you the option to integrate and build your following in a few easy steps.

Start by downloading [gatsby-plugin-mailchimp](https://github.com/benjaminhoffman/gatsby-plugin-mailchimp):

```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-mailchimp
```

Then configure the plugins

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "@narative/gatsby-theme-novela",
    options: {
      contentPosts: "content/posts",
      contentAuthors: "content/authors",
      basePath: "/",
      mailchimp: true, // make sure this is true!
    },
  },
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mailchimp",
    options: {
      endpoint: "", // add your MC list endpoint here; see plugin repo for instructions
    },
  },
];
```

That's it. You will now have subscription boxes on each of your Posts.
To disable the subscription box on individual Posts you can set `subscription: false` on the Post.

You can shadow the Subscription component to customize the text displayed. It is recommneded to copy and paste the current component and only alter the text.

You will want to override it here:

```
  novela-site
  └── src
    └── @narative
      └── gatsby-theme-novela
        └── components
          └── Subscription
            └── index.js
```

<br />

# Data Models

## Theme Options

It is recommended to use the Default options, but if your project requires something else you can configure them to your need.

| Option             |     Default     |                                        Description                                        |

| basePath           |        /        | Where should the site be served from? `/blog` will change all paths to start with `/blog` |
| mailchimp          |      false      |                        Enable Mailchimp subscriptions on each Post                        |
| sources.local      |      true       |                           Enable local file system data source                            |
| sources.contentful |      false      |                               Enable Contentful data source                               |

    title: `Novela by Narative`,
    name: `Narative`,
    siteUrl: `https://gatsby-theme-novela.netlify.com`,

    hero: {
      heading: `Perspectives on technology, design and business from the team at Narative.`,
